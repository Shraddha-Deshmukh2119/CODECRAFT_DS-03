### 🌟 CODECRAFT_DS-03: Decision Tree Classifier 🌳 <br>

Welcome to CODECRAFT_DS-03, a project where data meets decision-making! In this repository, we explore how to harness the power of machine learning to predict customer behavior using a Decision Tree Classifier.<br>

🧩 **Project Overview**<br>
In today’s data-driven world, understanding customer behavior is essential for businesses to thrive. This project focuses on building a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.<br>

🚀 **Objective**<br>
- Design and implement a Decision Tree Classifier.
- Analyze customer data to predict purchasing decisions.
- Provide actionable insights to improve decision-making.<br>

📂 **Repository Contents**<br>
- **CODE_CRAFT_INFOTECH_DS_03.ipynb:** The main Jupyter Notebook containing the step-by-step implementation of the Decision Tree Classifier.
- **Sample Data:** Clean and well-structured demographic and behavioral datasets for training and testing the model.
- **Visualization Outputs:** Charts and graphs to explain the decision tree structure and prediction results.<br>

🛠️ **Technologies Used**<br>
- Python: For programming the classifier.
**Libraries:**
 - pandas for data manipulation.
- numpy for numerical computations.
- sklearn for building and evaluating the Decision Tree Classifier.
- matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.<br>

📊 **Key Features**<br>
1] Data Preprocessing:<br>
Handled missing values and normalized data for better model performance.<br>
2] Model Building:<br>
Constructed a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn.<br>
3] Visualization:<br>
Visualized the tree structure to understand decision-making paths.<br>
4] Evaluation:<br>
Assessed model accuracy using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.<br>

🎯 **Results**<br>

- The Decision Tree successfully predicts customer purchasing decisions with high accuracy.
- Provides key insights into the most influential factors driving customer behavior.<br>

🤝 **How to Use**
1] Clone this repository:<br>
- git clone https://github.com/Shraddha-Deshmukh2119/CODECRAFT_DS-03.git  
2] Open the Jupyter Notebook in your favorite IDE (e.g., JupyterLab, VS Code).<br>
- Follow the step-by-step instructions to run the code.<br>

🌟 **Future Enhancements**
- Optimize the Decision Tree using hyperparameter tuning.
- Extend the project to include more advanced models like Random Forest and XGBoost.
- Incorporate real-time data streams for dynamic predictions.
